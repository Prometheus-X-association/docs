# Prometheus-X Catalog Registry

The Prometheus-X Catalog Registry is a REST API service designed to handle updates of reference models from the Prometheus-X Reference Models GitHub repository and synchronize them with a database. In addition, it provides support for catalog instance-defined reference models, including roles, value sharing, business models, building blocks, requirements, and more.

## Prometheus-X Service Ecosystem

The Catalog Registry is one of the components allowing management of the catalog. Even though it is independant and serves its own purpose, users of a catalog will need interaction with more than one service. Thus, if you want to run a full catalog, consider looking into deploying the [Catalog API](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/catalog-api) and the [Ecosystem Matcher](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/ecosystem-matcher).

In addition, the Prometheus-X Full specifications can be found on the [Prometheus-X docs repo/wiki](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/docs/wiki/Prometheus%E2%80%90X-Building-Blocks:-Enabling-Secure-Data-Ecosystems-and-Consent%E2%80%90driven-Data-Sharing)

## Features

The Prometheus-X Catalog Registry offers the following features:

1. **Reference Model Updates**: The service automates the process of updating reference models from the Prometheus-X Reference Models GitHub repository. It ensures that the latest versions are synchronized with the database, providing up-to-date information to catalog participants and administrators.

2. **Catalog Instance-defined Reference Models**: In addition to the core reference models, the registry allows catalog participants to define their own reference models. This feature enables customization and flexibility within the data ecosystem, accommodating specific roles, value sharing mechanisms, business models, building blocks, requirements, and other related entities.

3. **REST API**: The Prometheus-X Catalog Registry is built as a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate and interact with other services or applications. Catalog participants and data ecosystem administrators can utilize the API to retrieve and create information for the registry.
