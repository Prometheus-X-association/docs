# <type> indicates what kind of commit this is.
# It can be one of:
#   - feat        for new features introduced (i.e. MINOR in SemVer standard)
#   - fix         for bug-fixes (i.e. PATCH in SemVer standard)
#   - refactor    for rewriting or restructuring of code that does not affect API behavior
#   - build       for changes in build system or environment
#   - ci          for configuring continuous integration systems
#   - test        for adding new tests or correcting defective tests
#   - docs        for changes in documentation only
#   - chore       for miscellaneous tasks
#   - revert      for reverting commits made previously
#   - merge       for branch merges
#
# <scope> describes a section of the codebase where this change is applied and is optional.
# Note that allowed content of this section depends on the specific project.
# Issue identifiers are not valid scopes.
#
# Inserting "!" before the colon indicates that this commit introduces a breaking change.
# It is equivalent to a bump in MAJOR in SemVer standard.
# With this, the breaking change indicator in <footer> becomes optional.
#
# <description> contains a concise description of the change.
# The content should be in imperative mood, as if "This commit will..." is prepended.
# Do not capitalize the beginning of the sentence, and full stop (.) is omitted.
#
# <body> provides additional contextual information about the code changes and is optional.
# Multiple paragraphs separated by an empty line are allowed here.
# Sentences should be in imperative mood with proper capitalization and full stops (.).
#
# <footer> is a list of key-value pairs that store "metadata" of a commit.
# There are three types of a footer:
#   - Breaking change indicator     verbatim "BREAKING CHANGE:", followed by a <description>
#   - Automatic issue management    such as "Close #123", "Reference #123", "See #123", etc.
#   - Email-like metadata           such as "Signed-off-by:", "Co-authored-by", etc.
