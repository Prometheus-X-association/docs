# Data veracity assurance BB – Design Document

The Data Veracity Assurance building block (_DVA_ from now on) allows data exchange participants to agree on and later prove/verify quality requirements or properties of the exchanged data.

For example, if a data producer (abbreviated _P_ from now on) provides simple sensor data to a data consumer (_C_ from now on), DVA can facilitate _P_ to prove (and _C_ to verify) that the provided data is credible (eg, temperature values are within a certain range).

DVA requires a **veracity level agreement (VLA)** between the exchange participants.
The agreement is made for a specific data exchange unit, as described by the contract.
The VLA defines a number of **veracity objectives** that each describe a **data quality aspect** (eg, _completeness_ or _accuracy_) and an **evaluation scheme** (eg, value is within a numerical range).
When the data exchange occurs, in the simplest model, P attaches a proof (or at least an attestation) regarding the exchanged data’s quality that C trusts or can verify.

## Technical Usage Scenarios & Features

With DVA, data exchange participants can be assured that the data fulfils predefined quality requirements.

### Features/Main Functionalities

Key functionalities:
1. Manage data veracity level agreements (VLAs)
2. Provide means to…
   * attest to
   * prove
   * verify
   the veracity of exchanged data
3. Log veracity verification results

Additional functionalities:
* Potentially enable proving/verifying data properties that are related to further _sensitive_ (eg, due to GDPR) data _without disclosing the sensitive data_

### Technical Usage Scenarios

#### Management of Veracity Level Agreements (VLAs)

VLAs describe exactly what data quality P ‘promises’ and/or C expects.
The format and exact contents of VLAs is further detailed later in this document.

It is among the primary functionalities of DVA to facilitate
* _striking_ VLAs (which is possibly also related to the _Contract_ module)
* _querying_ VLAs for a given data exchange
* _changing_ the terms of VLAs (if this functionality is desired)
* _revoking_ VLAs (if this functionality is desired)

DVA of course also provides the means for P to prove (or attest) and C to verify that the exchanged data fulfils the requirements set by the VLA; see below.

#### Proving, Attestation, and Verification of Veracity

There are chiefly two ways P can offer veracity assurance regarding the exchanged data:
1. By presenting a **Proof of Veracity (PoV)** to C (by sending it together with the data itself)
2. By sharing an **Attestation of Veracity (AoV)**

The latter is obviously the ‘weaker’ option, but depending on the use case, it may be enough, or _proving_ adherence to the VLA may not be possible.

A PoV is a (cryptographic) proof generated by P (or potentially a third party) of the claim ‘the data in question fulfils the requirements in the VLA’.
C can reliably _verify_ these proofs.
Such proofs should be _sound,_ meaning that a cheating P cannot forge a PoV for a piece of data that does not adhere to the VLA’s requirements.
<!-- TODO a simple example of a PoV? -->

AoVs are simpler because they are non-verifiable (at least not in the sense as PoVs).
Attestations rely on trust – for example, a trusted third party may give their attestation that the data is indeed in line with the VLA requirements.
It is C’s trust in the third party that assures them of the veracity of the data, not actual proof.
An even ‘weaker’ but still noteworthy option is when P attests to the veracity of the data themselves.
At the very least, they _claim_ that the data is in line with the VLA and can be later held to their claim if C discovers otherwise.

Finally, there may not even be a proof or attestation, merely a direct check of the data’s veracity by C.

DVA defines what proofs and attestations are (see later in this document) and provides means to generate PoVs, AoVs, and to verify veracity.

#### Logging of Results

DVA also keeps track of veracity verification results for traceability purposes.

## Integrations

### Direct Integrations with Other BBs

* As VLAs are similar to contracts (or will become part of the contracts), DVA will have interactions with the **Contract** component


### Integrations via Connector

* DVA will directly integrate with the **Dataspace Connector** itself to extend data exchange flows with veracity assurance steps
* Potential integrations with **Consent** as well (?)
* DVA will also have integrations with the **Data Value Chain Tracker** BB
  * The _value_ is strongly related to the quality of the data assured by DVA


## Relevant Standards

### Data Format Standards

* VLAs will be encoded in [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
* In all likelihood, DVA will parse and/or serialize into [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) files for interoperability.
* For configuration, DVA will use [TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

### Other Standards

There are ISO standards that define data-quality-related concepts:
* [ISO 8000-61:2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/63086.html) – Data Quality – Part 61: Data quality management: Process reference model
* [ISO/IEC 25000:2014](https://www.iso.org/standard/64764.html) – Systems and software engineering – Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)

Other possibly relevant standards and specifications:
* [Data Contracts](https://datacontract.com/), which are very similar to VLAs, have a [standard](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard)

### Mapping to Data Space Reference Architecture Models

## Configuration & Deployment Settings

One of the main questions is how many DVA instances there are in a data space.
For example, there may be a single centralized DVA instance that can be contacted by the connectors during data exchange.
However, a more advantageous approach is to have a decentralized configuration with several DVA instances.
There may be a DVA instance at the participating organizations – eg, P can use their own DVA instance to generate the proof or attestation that will be passed together with the data to C.
Likewise, C may use their ‘local’ DVA instance to perform the verification.

Going further, all the DVA instances may form a blockchain.
Using privacy-preserving features (such as private data in Hyperledger Fabric) it is possible for only the data exchange participants to see the proofs generated, while other data space participants merely see a record of the proof having been generated on the blockchain (as a commitment).


## Third Party Components & Licenses

## Implementation Details

## OpenAPI Specification

The current specification can be found in [`spec/openapi.yaml`](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/data-veracity/blob/main/spec/openapi.yaml).


## Test Specification

### Test Plan

The primary objective of testing will be to validate the correct handling of exchanged data compliant and non-compliant with the quality aspects established in the VLA.
Several data examples (including correct and incorrect samples) will be used for these tests.
Various data quality aspects will be targeted and case studies will be conducted using different data types used in the main project use cases, like VR traces (xAPI), Moodle learning traces (xAPI), and skills (ontology/terminology).

The integration with the _Dataspace Connector_ component will be tested thoroughy to verify that the necessary interactions are indeed possible and that error cases are handled properly (eg, when no data is received during a data exchange or data _is_ received but without a PoV/AoV even though it would be required).

While DVA will not directly integrate with the _Contract_ component, it should be tested that DVA can recognize VLA fragments defined in the contracts and that it is possible to extend existing contracts with VLA fragments.
In the end, this functionality will be provided by (or at least _via_) the _Catalogue,_ not this BB.

Furthermore, interactions with other components, such as the _Data Value Chain Tracker (DVCT)_ will be validated through testing, as these potentially involve new interactions, protocols, and interfaces.

The DVA BB test acceptance critieria are, informally, and without striving for completeness:
* VLAs can be struck and parsed from contracts.
* DVA correctly handles data fulfilling the criteria in the corresponding VLA as well as data that is non-compliant.
* DVA can successfully communicate with the _Dataspace Connector_ and be a part of the data exchange flow.
* AoVs and PoVs can be created via DVA.
* No PoVs can be created for data that does not fulfil the VLA.
