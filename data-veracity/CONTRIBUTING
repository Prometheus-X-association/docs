# How to Contribute


## How to Make a Contribution?

Open an issue (if one does not exist already) for your problem.
Then, make your changes on a separate feature branch with the name `<issue_number>-<short_identifier>` and open a pull request.

For example, let’s say you think the build process of the project should be thoroughly documented.
Then, you would do the following:
1. Open a new issue with the title ‘Document build process in detail’ and explain why this is necessary.  Let’s say the new issue got the identifier `#83`.
2. Create a new branch called `83-build_docs` and write the documentation.
3. Create a pull request, merging `83-build_docs` into `main`.


## Conventions Used in this Project

### Git Conventions

**Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).**

You can configure Git locally to use the template in this directory like this:
```shell-session
$ git config commit.template docs/commit-message-template.txt
```

We use the following commit types:
* `feat` – for modifications in functional features, often breaking changes
* `fix` – for commits that fix bugs or minor issues
* `refactor` – for changes that do not affect externally observed behaviour
* `test` – commits related to testing
* `docs` – changes to documentation
* `build` – changes related to the (local) build environment/process, dependencies, etc
* `ci` – changes to the CI pipeline
* `chore` – miscellaneous, like adding a line to .gitignore
* `revert` – for revert commits
* `merge` – for merge commits

For now, we do not use scopes.

Please write concise but useful commit bodies where applicable.

Examples:

```
feat: allow orchestrators to delete VLA templates
```

```
build: require Java 21

We have decided to use the new features introduced in Java 21 such as [foo] and [bar].
```

```
chore: add target directory to gitignore
```
